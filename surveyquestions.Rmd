For most of the questions (business models, values, paradox management topics), the firms were asked to indicate the extent to which these statements are true about their firm, or their business model (1=not at all, 7=very true). 
  
For the performance measures, the firms were asked to evaluate how much better they have done with respect to each aspect over the last 3 years, relative to their main competitors. (1=much worse, 7=much better).   
  
```{r surveyvariables, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(kableExtra)
require(knitr)
require(dplyr)

surveyvariables<- read.csv("~/Dropbox/1PhD/Articles/Survey Data/surveyquestions.csv") 

surveyvariables[,-1] %>%
  kable(row.names = F)
```
