  title: "What can I do?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My passion lies in initiatives that make this world a better place (as cheesy as it sounds), and do so through a lense of compassion and inclusive observation.
    My work addresses the human aspects of climate crisis and systemic social change, intersecting an evidence-based understanding of how and why we do things, strategy design, and hands-on collaborative solution crafting.  
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Currently, as a Managing Consultant at Think Change Resolve in Sydney, Australia, I spearhead strategic consulting projects that address complex organizational and policy challenges in domains such as health, education, social policy, and sustainability. 
    We help teams and organisations to face and embrace difficult but needed change.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Previously, as a Senior Researcher and Agile Project Owner at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindworkslab.org/">Mindworks</a>, I designed and managed campaign innovations aimed at mindset shifts for climate crisis mitigation and adaptation, translating complex social and cognitive science insights into actionable strategies and tools. These included capacity building learning experiences, research designs for mindset monitoring, campaigning tools, strategising support etc. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My work has always been about bridging gaps—whether between disciplines, ideas, or people—to foster resilient and adaptive communities.  I have worked in and thought about diverse fields, so my strength is creating solutions and concepts that are rooted in unusual combinations of ideas.
    My research and cosultancy experience can be explained as a mix of these keywords: 
    social psychology, environmental campaigning, strategy and innovation management, research and data science (I am a dedicated R fan <3), business models, paradox management,
    placemaking, creative industries, urban economics, and learning experiences.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I am actively seeking collaborations that align with my passion for creating scalable solutions for environmental and social resilience, whether through consulting opportunities, partnerships, or voluteering. 
    Do not hesitate to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ie.rozentale@gmail.com">contact me</a> or find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ieva-rozentale-83446739/">LinkedIn</a> if you are interested to collaborate or simply want to chat about the work
   we do, or anything else.
