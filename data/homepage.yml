  title: "What can I do?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My passion lies in initiatives that innovate for making this world a better place. 
    I currently work mainly with projects that deal with the climate crisis - either <b>finding 
    scalable, often cross-disciplinary solutions to increase climate awareness and action, or developing resilience 
    and adaptation capacities of (urban) communities.</b>  
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I have worked in diverse fields, so my strength is creating solutions and concepts 
    that are rooted in unusual combinations of ideas.
    My current and prior research and cosultancy experience can be best explained by these keywords: 
    ecopsychology, environmental campaigning, strategic design and design
    thinking, research and data science (I am a dedicated R fan <3), chatbots, business models, paradox management,
    placemaking, creative industries, and urban economics.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
   At the moment, I am spending most of my time working as a senior researcher and project lead at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindworkslab.org/">Mindworks</a> - 
   a cognitive science lab for Greenpeace EA. We work at the instersection of climate action, psychology and campaigning, and we are 
   frequently looking for partner organizations, funders, and/or freelancers to share our work with.  
   I am also always happpy to consider any interesting projects to join during some of my unused freelancee hours, individually, as 
   well as sharing the expertise of the two collectives I am part of - <a target="_blank" href="https://urbanconnectors.nl/">Urban Connectors</a> (democratic urban transitions and innovation) and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nebetja.eu/">nēbetjā</a> (placemaking, redirective practices, nomadic universities).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
   Do not hesitate to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ie.rozentale@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you are interested to collaborate or simply want to chat about the work
   we do, or anything else.

This is still an early pilot, you can go and chat with it follwing the link. We are currently woring on exploring further the usefulness of chatbots for environmental campaigns, so I would love to connect if you happen to be interested in / experienced with the tool."
