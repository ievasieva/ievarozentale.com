  title: "What can I do?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My passion lies in initiatives that make this world a better place (as cheesy as it sounds), and do so through a lense of compassion and inclusive observation.
    I am presently focusing on projects that somehow deal with the climate crisis - either <b>finding 
    scalable, often cross-disciplinary communication-based solutions to increase climate awareness and action, or developing resilience 
    and adaptation capacities of (urban) communities.</b>  
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
   At the moment, I am spending most of my time working as a senior researcher and project lead at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindworkslab.org/">Mindworks</a> - 
   a cognitive science lab for Greenpeace EA. We work at the instersection of climate action, psychology and campaigning, and we are 
   frequently looking for partner organizations, funders, and/or freelancers to share our work with.  
      </p>
   <p class="lead">
   I am always happpy to consider any interesting projects to join during some of my unused freelancee hours - individually or 
   sharing the expertise of the two collectives I am part of - <a target="_blank" href="https://urbanconnectors.nl/">Urban Connectors</a> (democratic urban transitions, community building, stakeholder management) and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nebetja.eu/">nēbetjā</a> (placemaking, redirective practices, nomadic universities).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I have worked in and thought about diverse fields, so my strength is creating solutions and concepts 
    that are rooted in unusual combinations of ideas.
    My research and cosultancy experience can be explained as a mix of these keywords: 
    social psychology, environmental campaigning, strategic design and design
    thinking, research and data science (I am a dedicated R fan <3), chatbots, business models, paradox management,
    placemaking, creative industries, urban economics, and pedagogy.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
   Do not hesitate to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ie.rozentale@gmail.com">contact me</a> or find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ieva-rozentale-83446739/">LinkedIn</a> if you are interested to collaborate or simply want to chat about the work
   we do, or anything else.
