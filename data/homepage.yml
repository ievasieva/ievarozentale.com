  title: "What can I do?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    My passion lies in initiatives that innovate for making this world a better place. 
    I currently work mainly with projects that deal with climate crisis - either <b>finding 
    scalable solutions to increase climate awareness and action, or developing resilience 
    and adaptation capacities of (urban) communities.</b>  
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I have worked in diverse fields, so my strength is creating solutions and concepts 
    that are rooted in unusual combinations of ideas.
    My current and prior experience can be best explained by these keywords: 
    climate (crisis) psychology, environmental campaigning, strategic design and design
    thinking, research and data analytics, chatbots, business models, paradox management,
    placemaking, creative industries, and urban development.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
   At the moment, I am looking for interesting projects to join during some of my unused freelancee hours. We are
   also always looking for partner organizations, funders, and/or freelancers to join our work at Mindworks (see below).
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
   Send me a message if you are interested to collaborate or simply want to chat about the work
   I do, or anything else. And please check out the pages of the organizations and collectives 
   I am part of.

But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
